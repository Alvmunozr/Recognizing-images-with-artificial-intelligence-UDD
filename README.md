# Recognizing-images-with-artificial-intelligence-UDD
This project for UDD's Semana I uses the YOLO model to detect and count cars and people in videos. Users define areas of interest by drawing polylines named "car" or "person." The system tracks objects crossing these lines and generates bar charts showing the total counts.
