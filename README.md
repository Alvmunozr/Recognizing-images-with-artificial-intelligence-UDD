# Recognizing-images-with-artificial-intelligence-UDD

SUMMARY:
This project, developed for the Universidad del Desarrollo (UDD) as part of Semana I, uses the YOLO model to detect and count cars and people in videos. Users define areas of interest by drawing polylines named "car" or "person." The system tracks objects crossing these lines and generates bar charts showing the total counts.

FULL DESC:
This project, developed for the Universidad del Desarrollo (UDD) as part of Semana I, focuses on detecting and counting cars and people in a video using artificial intelligence, specifically the YOLO model. The objective is to analyze the flow of people and vehicles within defined areas, such as a parking lot or an access route. The system allows users to draw "polylines" on the video, which must be named "car" or "person", a crucial requirement to correctly associate the detected objects.

As cars and people cross these polylines, the system tracks and counts the crossings, preventing duplicate counts by assigning unique IDs to each detected object. After the video has been processed, bar charts are generated to display the total number of cars and people that crossed each polyline. This tool provides a clear visualization of movement within the defined areas of interest, with potential applications in managing traffic and people flow in public spaces.
